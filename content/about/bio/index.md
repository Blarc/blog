Hi, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jakob**, a developer from Slovenia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡®. I've always been fascinated by how things work. During my second year of
college, I started as a backend developer at [Medius](https://www.medius.si/). It didnâ€™t take long for me to realize the
vast ecosystem of tools
and principles that power modern applications. Wanting to understand the bigger picture, I transitioned into a DevOps
role.

Since then, Iâ€™ve been on a continuous journey of exploring infrastructure, networking, containerization, orchestration
tools, security, and CI/CDâ€”everything that makes application development and deployment smoother. My work has primarily
involved **Bash scripts**, **GitLab pipelines**, **Kubernetes**, **Helm**, **Kustomize**, and **Argo CD**, along with
many other tools. I'm always on the lookout for the next tool or Kubernetes operator that can boost developer
productivity or reduce maintenance overhead.

At the same time, I haven't lost my passion for coding. I love building backends in **Java with Quarkus**, crafting
**Android apps and IntelliJ plugins in Kotlin**, and occasionally dabbling in **Go and Rust**. On the frontend side,
Iâ€™ve explored **React and Angular**, but thereâ€™s still a lot to learn.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate simplicity in engineering. The overwhelming number of tools and frameworks can
make things unnecessarily complex, which is why I try to follow
the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). I also discovered the wisdom of
[grug](https://grugbrain.dev/), which is slowly becoming my sacred scroll of truth.

This blog is a space where Iâ€™ll share my experiences, projects, and insights from my developer journey. Thanks for
stopping byâ€”letâ€™s learn and build together! ðŸš€
